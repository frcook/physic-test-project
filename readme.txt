Viva la Physicaca

This is a simple little project that will help me understand Bullet physics 
a whole lot better. The agenda is to create a simple project with the bar
necesities including SDL, SDL_image, opengl, glu, glew, and BulletPhysics.
I'm not going to make this into a game it just a way to help test out 
BulletPhysics library so I can make it go around my fingers more than it
does at the moment.
